README


The program contains a total of 16 CLASSES , them being :

- Hero : class from which i derived Rogue, Wizard, Pyromancer , Knight
- Abilities : class from which i derived AbilitiesRogue, AbilitiesWizard,
 AbilitiesPyromancer, AbilitiesKnight
- Main : the class that contains the main method 
- FileReader, FileWriter, IWriter(interface), IReader(interface), FileSystem
 from fileio used for working with files

DOUBLE DISPATCH : 

-I tried to implement the double dispatch in a way that each character can 
accept each opponent's abilities , therefore in a Knight type there are 5 
accept methods overloaded with the following signature :

 public final void accept(final Abilities a) {
a.interactWith(this);
}

 while in the AbilitiesKnight there are methods such as this : 

 void interactWith(final Hero e) {

}

EXPLANATION:

~ Hero :

 contains the important fields that are the same for all characters 
such as : x, y, level, alive(checks if the character is still alive - boolean),
 contorRound, contorMove(used for DoT purposes), abilityToMOve(boolean),xp, 
totalDamage(which will then be substracted from the hp), 
damagePerRound(for DoT purposes), damageWizard (in each AbilitiesCharacter on
 a fight with the wizard , the damage given to it will be stored here 
, to be used later on the deflect ability)
The constructor of the Hero class has 2 parameters : x and y
-each derived class , for example Knight will instantiate the necessary abilites
 and specific parameters such as hp, type
- the change method makes the levelUp changes to the parameters

~ Abilities : 
 
example : 
-AbilitiesKnight : the constructor initiates the necessary parameters , using 
magic numbers (the parameters will change with the level so they can not be directly
 final ), in the calculus i used floats , so that in the end i apply the Math.round()

~ Main :

 the static variables are used to read the content of the file 
-the array of Heros named personaje will keep the characters and change their parameters
 , i iterate through the rounds , check the position of characters and where i find two
 characters alive at the same spot , the battle begins 
- one important condition is that the wizard is the second to attack so that the 
damageWizard parameter can be calculated(for deflect), 
- after each hero has accepted 
the opponent's abilities , if one is dead and the other alive , the xp will be 
modified and the level  in some cases
- in the end , each character status will be displayed
